# POSSM

Below is a description of the Public Open Source Soil Monitoring tool or POSSM for fufillment of IST 440.

Contained within this repository is all of the code neccessary to build and deploy an instance of POSSM on your own hardware. The steps below outline how to install the correct software on both the Raspberry Pi as well as the AWS instance in order to get POSSM working properly.

# Raspberry Pi

First, you must install the following Python modules in order for the moisture.py file to run correctly on the Pi. Raspberry Pi's already come pre-installed with Python, so we don't need to worry about that. Type the following commands in the terminal on the Pi: "pip install boto3" and "pip install csv". The second package should already be installed by default. 



# AWS
